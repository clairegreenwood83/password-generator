# password-generator

## Description
I created an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. The app can run in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

### Project Specification

The instructions for the task were as follows:

Generate a password when the button is clicked present a series of prompts for password criteria:

- Length of password
  At least 10 characters but no more than 64.

- Character types
  Lowercase
  Uppercase
  Numeric
  Special characters ($@%&*, etc)

- Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
- Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Deployment

The password generator can be accessed [here.](https://clairegreenwood83.github.io/password-generator/)

Once the web browser is open, click on the generate password button. The user will then be taken through a series of prompts allowing them to determine how long the password will be and whether they would like it to contain uppercase, lowercase, numerical or special characters. The password generated will then be shown in the browser. Currently, the code is unable to generate the password to the browser, further code development is required and intended to rectify this. 

The web browser looks as shown below:
